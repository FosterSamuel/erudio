# Erudio

My thoughts and opinions on teaching.

## Website
Erudio is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and automatically deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Theme
LeanLearn is a barebones theme I'm making to structure content on the website. Feel free to use, copy, and modify it.

## Responding
If there is an issue with the website, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/FosterSamuel/erudio/issues/new). Want to respond or discuss? The easiest way to reach me is [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-foster/).
