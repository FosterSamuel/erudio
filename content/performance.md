In front of thirty classmates, I froze. I couldn't remember the words to the middle of my speech. Mr. Baumwirt told me to jump to the conclusion which, thankfully, I had memorized. I recited the ending and returned to my seat feeling embarassed.

A week later the speech was graded a low C, which is barely average. There was no debating it. I studied, practiced, and still failed the speech. If I fixated on the grade, however, my speaking would not improve.

We also need performance to track progress, to see where learners are, and to have a hierarchical education system. Let's take a step away.
