On the first day Dr. Garland said we had no homework. We only had to visit his office hours.

In the cramped room piles of papers and books buried his desk. I asked him about his path in the subject. He started sharing but interrupted himself. On a small blackboard he drew a large circle, calling it the world of math. Inside the circle he placed a tiny dot. "This," he said. "This is my life's contribution."

Years of focus power every teacher. Unfortunately, in the classroom, the same focus can unintentionally blind the material. Over time the teacher moves away from relating to the experience of a fresh learner. Let's change that.

## The Narrowed World

A new learner has previous ideas and feelings. Refresh them by bringing the subject to the present. Every pitfall and success in the subject's history is another opportunity to heal the learner's expectations. Take liberty in picking stories that cross discipline and location.

The stories should show practical use or interesting history of the subject. For example, if teaching historical preservation, talk about a peculiar find that was uncovered during a building restoration. 

History, and other content-focused subjects, will have more readily available stories. For their case, the presentation and interactions with the stories will be more important. For example, instead of reciting an event in history, framing the context of one story and how it led to the decisions will captivate listeners. This example can be driven further by showing how a later event could have learned from the previous situation, demonstrating the importance of studying history.

With the world narrowed by stories a big question emerges: why the new material? Push the learners with questions that show the need for the material. 

## The Day
If the need is apparent, learners silently demand an answer. Aim the collective force of that answer at the learner's day. The new material connects, somewhere, to their day. Whether for solving problems or analyzing situations, the subject fits. 

Dr. Garland never told us multivariable calculus, by itself, was important. He spent the first two weeks of class rebuilding earlier calculus, showing how it fit into the world and where it fell short. The problems it couldn't solve needed new math. We were curious and ready to learn.
