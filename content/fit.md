On the first day of multivariable calculus Dr. Garland said we had no homework. We only had to visit his office hours.

In the cramped room piles of papers and books buried his desk. I asked him about his path in the subject. He started sharing but interrupted himself. On a small blackboard he drew a large circle, calling it the world of math. Inside the circle he placed a tiny dot. "This," he said. "This is my life's contribution."

Years of focus power every teacher. Unfortunately, in the classroom, the same focus can unintentionally blind the material. Over time the teacher moves away from relating to the experience of a fresh learner. Let's change that.

## The Narrowed World

Previous ideas, experiences, and feelings about a class form a mental barrier. A class justified by requirement alone thickens the barrier. 

Refresh learners with stories from the subject. Every adventure, pitfall, and success is a chance to heal expectations, chipping away at the mental barrier. 

The most effective stories show practical use. For example, if teaching historical preservation, talk about a peculiar find from a building restoration. The restoration process being careful enough to uncover something indirectly proves practical need for the class. 

Some argue history, and other content-focused subjects, can't show practical use. For those subjects, the presentation and interaction of stories show their usefulness. Instead of reciting a moment in history, captivate learners by framing the context of the event and how it led to the outcome. Strengthen the example with a later event that could have learned from the previous one, showing the practical importance of studying history.

Stories also narrow the world of the class. An important question emerges: why the new material? Push the learners with questions that show the need. 

## The Day
If the need is apparent, learners silently demand an answer. Aim the force of that answer at the day of the learner. The new material connects, somewhere, to their daily life. Whether for solving problems or understanding situations, the subject fits. 

Dr. Garland never told us multivariable calculus, by itself, was important. He spent the first two weeks of class rebuilding earlier calculus, showing how it fit into the world and where it fell short. The problems it couldn't solve needed new math. We were curious and ready to learn.
