On the first day Dr. Garland said we had no homework. We only had to visit his office hours.

In the cramped room piles of papers and books buried his desk. I asked him about his path in the subject. He started sharing but interrupted himself. On a small blackboard he drew a large circle, calling it the world of math. Inside the circle he placed a tiny dot. "This," he said. "This is my life's contribution."

Years of focus power every teacher. Unfortunately, in the classroom, the same focus can unintentionally blind the material. With time the teacher moves away from relating to the experience of a fresh learner. 

Dr. Garland never told us multivariable calculus was important. He spent the first two weeks of class rebuilding earlier calculus, showing how it fit into the world and where it fell short. The problems it couldn't solve needed new math. We were ready to learn.

## Global

The subject fits into the world and our day. Show them how.
