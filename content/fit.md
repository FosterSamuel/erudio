On the first day Dr. Garland said we had no homework. We only had to visit his office hours.

In the cramped room piles of papers and books buried his desk. I asked him about his path in the subject. He started sharing but interrupted himself. On a small blackboard he drew a large circle, calling it the world of math. Inside the circle he placed a tiny dot. "This," he said. "This is my life's contribution."

Years of focus power every teacher. Unfortunately, in the classroom, the same focus can unintentionally blind the material. With time the teacher moves away from relating to the experience of a fresh learner. Let us change that.

## The Narrowed World

Before new material begins, all is possible. Refresh learners by showing how the subject got to the present. Take liberty in picking stories that cross disciplines and places. Every pitfall and success in the subject history is another opportunity to win the curiousity of a learner.

With the world narrowed a big question emerges: why the new material? Push the learners' curiousity with questions. Thoughtful questions show the need for the material.   

## The Day
