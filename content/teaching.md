Someone was curious about a subject. They read blog posts, watched YouTube tutorials, and started a weekend project. Genuine interest drove them to learn.

Self-learning is now at its most accessible. The internet connects you to every subject and their fervent communities. There, the pundits and novices sharpen each other. The discourse excites and frustrates the Undergraduate. What value does traditional teaching offer that the community does not?

# Worthwhile Errors
Good mistakes kindle learning. For example, writers learn by reanimating dead sentences. Online resources, however, tell new writers to never write in the passive voice. 

Communities follow the same pattern. A new learner posts the wrong answer. An experienced learner shreds it and responds with a correct one. The answer, while informative, may not explain valuable missteps.

The teacher knows, encourages, and builds a space to learn from worthwhile errors.

# The Middle
Self-learners struggle in the middle. The internet teems with beginner and expert material, leaving a chasm for intermediate content. 

Knowing what a learner does not know is hard. Assuming they know nothing or almost everything is easier. [ expand this section ]

The teacher guides you across the middle. Along the way they show the true width of the middle and the what can be learned in each path. The learner decides which paths to take, saving time and focus.

# Pushing Self-learning
Traditional teaching trickles the subject down to the student. Mandatory readings increase the transfer rate. Exams monitor the transfer and promise an accurate reading.
