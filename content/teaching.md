Communities for every subject make their home on the internet, a place for international pundits and novices to sharpen each other. The discourse excites and frustrates self-learners, making them wonder: what value does traditional teaching offer that fervent communities do not?

# Worthwhile Errors
New writers go online and learn the absolute rule: never write in the passive voice. The learners then stare at a blank page, shifting words in their head, hesistant to break the rule by starting with a bad sentence. They miss out on writing and reanimating dead sentences.

Communities fall to the same pattern of absolutism. When new learners share misguided projects or thoughts, experienced members respond by shredding the results. The sharp and informative answer redirects the learner, but it often fails to highlight the value of the mistake.

Good mistakes kindle learning. The teacher can build a space to encourage and learn from worthwhile errors. 

# The Middle
Self-learners struggle in the middle. Beginner and expert material fill the internet, leaving a chasm for intermediate content.

Teaching online is easier when one assumes the learner knows nothing or almost everything. When the assumption is avoided, material is whittled to one smooth path. This cuts away alternative paths and how they fit the middle.

The teacher can guide you across the middle. Along the way the true width of the subject becomes visible. The learner decides which paths to take, saving time and focus.

# New Approach
Traditional teaching trickles the subject down to the student. Mandatory readings grow the transfer rate. Exams monitor the transfer with promises of an accurate reading.

The current model proved itself. Information evolved, however, to be always available. A gap separates students who expand their learning with the internet. The divide will grow.

I propose teaching adapt by focusing on its inherent strengths.
