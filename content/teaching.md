I wanted to learn topology. I watched YouTube tutorials, read blog posts, and started on basic problems. Genuine interest drove me.

Self-learning is now at its most accessible. The internet connects you to every subject and their fervent communities. There, the pundits and novices sharpen each other. The discourse excites and frustrates the Undergraduate. What value does traditional teaching offer that the community does not?

# Worthwhile Errors
Good mistakes kindle learning. For example, writers learn by reanimating dead sentences. Online resources, however, tell new writers to never write in the passive voice. 

Communities follow the same pattern. A new learner posts the wrong answer. An experienced learner shreds it and responds with a correct one. The answer, while informative, may not explain valuable missteps.

The teacher knows, encourages, and builds a space to learn from worthwhile errors.

# The Middle
Self-learners struggle in the middle. The internet teems with beginner and expert material, leaving a chasm for intermediate content. 

Teaching online is easier when you assume the learner knows nothing or almost everything. When attempting to teach the middle online, material is wittled smooth. This cuts away alternative paths and how they fit the middle.

The teacher guides you across the middle. Along the way they show the true width of the subject and what can be learned in each path. The learner decides which paths to take, saving time and focus.

# New Approach
Traditional teaching trickles the subject down to the student. Mandatory readings grow the transfer rate. Exams monitor the transfer with promises of an accurate reading.

The current model proved itself. Information evolved, however, to be always available. A gap separates students who expand their learning with the internet. The divide will grow.

I propose teaching adapt by focusing on its inherent strengths.
