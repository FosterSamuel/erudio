Someone was curious about a subject. They read blog posts, culled research papers, watched YouTube tutorials, and started a weekend project. Genuine interest drove them to learn.

Self-learning is now at its most accessible. The internet connects you to a subject and its fervent communities. The subject's pundits and novices sharpen eachother. The discourse frustrates the Undergraduate. What value does teaching reliably provide that the community does not?

# Common mistakes
Mistakes are valuable to learning, and many of the common ones need to be experienced first-hand. For example, telling students to "not write in the passive voice" robs them of learning from the impact of converting sentences to the active voice.

Avoidance of good mistakes is wasteful. The teacher knows good mistakes, encourages them, and shows students how to learn from them. At the same time, the teacher saves a new learner time by notifying common mistakes that are wasteful or misleading.

# The middle
The hardest part of self-learning is the middle. Beginner and expert content fills the internet. Intermediate content is rare. Teaching is easier when one  assumes the reader knows nothing or most everything about a subject.

The dilligent teacher takes you across the middle. Along the way they show  the true width of the middle and the material covered in each path. The learner decides which paths to take, saving time and focus.

# Pushing self-learning
Traditional teaching trickles down information to the student.
