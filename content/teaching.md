I wanted to learn topology. I watched YouTube tutorials, read blog posts, and started on basic problems.

Self-learning is at a new level of accessibility. The internet brings you every subject and its  fervent communities. There, the pundits and novices sharpen each other. The discourse excites and frustrates the Undergraduate. What value does traditional teaching offer that the community does not?

# Worthwhile Errors
New writers go online and learn the absolute rule: never write in the passive voice. So they don't. They miss out on writing and reanimating dead sentences.

<blockquote><p>But I kept typing; pouring inane, kindergarten-level drivel into my phone.</p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://tjcx.me/posts/consumption-distraction/">Tom Cleveland, "Consume less, create more"</a></blockquote>

Communities follow the same pattern. A new learner posts the wrong answer. An experienced learner shreds it and responds with a correct one. The informative answer often does not explain the valuable missteps.

Good mistakes kindle learning. The teacher can build a space to encourage and learn from worthwhile errors.

# The Middle
Self-learners struggle in the middle. Beginner and expert material fill the internet, leaving a chasm for intermediate content. 

Teaching online is easier when you assume the learner knows nothing or almost everything. When the assumption is avoided, material is wittled to one smooth path. This cuts away alternative paths and how they fit the middle.

The teacher can guide you across the middle. Along the way the true width of the subject becomes visible. The learner decides which paths to take, saving time and focus.

# New Approach
Traditional teaching trickles the subject down to the student. Mandatory readings grow the transfer rate. Exams monitor the transfer with promises of an accurate reading.

The current model proved itself. Information evolved, however, to be always available. A gap separates students who expand their learning with the internet. The divide will grow.

I propose teaching adapt by focusing on its inherent strengths.
