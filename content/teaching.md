Communities for every subject make their home on the internet, a place for international pundits and novices to sharpen each other. The evergreen discourse excites and frustrates self-learners, making them wonder: what value does traditional teaching offer that fervent communities do not?

# Worthwhile Errors
New writers go online and learn the absolute rule: never write in the passive voice. The learners then stare at a blank page, shifting words in their head, hesistant to break the rule by starting with a bad sentence. They miss out on writing and reanimating dead sentences.

Communities fall to the same pattern of absolutism. When new learners share misguided projects or thoughts, experienced members respond by shredding the results. The sharp and informative answer redirects the learner, but it often fails to highlight the value of the mistake. The experienced learner did not become experienced by dismissing their own mistakes. 

Experience discerns the good mistakes from bad, and an effective teacher can build a space for learners to make and learn from the worthwhile errors.

# Missing Content
Self-learners also struggle in the middle. Beginner and expert material fill the internet, leaving a chasm for intermediate learning. How does a teacher know how much a learner does not know?

Teaching online is easier when one assumes the learner knows nothing or almost everything. If the assumption is skipped, the material gets whittled to a clean lesson plan, one smooth path. 

Navigating any new subject is messy and difficult. Paths sprawl to other sub-subjects, weaving in and away, each with their own expert telling learners this or that is the One Path.

Self-learners cope with the absence of intermediate learning by relentlessly writing, solving, and building. I support and encourage that. However, many more hours are lost wandering in the middle than the average learner needs. I believe the sheer will of self-learning can be complemented by well-travelled teachers.

The travelled teacher can guide learners across the middle, showing any number of paths. Along the way the true width of the subject becomes visible. The learner decides which paths to take, saving time and focus.

# New Approach
Traditional teaching trickles the subject down to the student. Mandatory readings grow the transfer rate. Exams monitor the transfer with promises of an accurate reading.

The current model proved itself. Information evolved, however, to be always available. A gap separates students who expand their learning with the internet. The divide will grow.

I propose teaching adapt by focusing on its inherent strengths.
