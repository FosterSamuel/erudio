Communities for every subject make their home on the internet, a place for international pundits and novices to sharpen each other. The evergreen discourse excites and frustrates self-learners, making them wonder: what value does traditional teaching offer that fervent communities do not?

# Worthwhile Errors
New writers go online and learn the absolute rule: never write in the passive voice. Facing a blank page, learners juggle words and hesitate to break the rule by starting with a bad sentence. They miss out on writing and reanimating dead sentences.

Communities fall to the same pattern of absolutism. When new learners share misguided projects or thoughts, experienced members respond by shredding the results. The sharp and informative answer redirects the learner, but it often fails to highlight the value of the mistake. The experienced learner did not become experienced by dismissing their own mistakes. 

Experience discerns the good mistakes from bad, and an effective teacher can build a space for learners to make and learn from the worthwhile errors.

# The Middle
Self-learners also struggle in the middle. Beginner and expert material fill the internet, leaving a chasm for intermediate learning. When creating educational content for the internet, it is easier to assume the learner knows nothing or almost everything. Skipping the assumption whittles down the subject material to a clean lesson plan, one smooth path. 

Navigating any new subject is messy and difficult. Weaving in and away, paths sprawl to other sub-subjects, each with their own expert telling learners this or that is the One Path You Need. All routes in learning are valid, but with limited time, self-learners are forced to cope by relentlessly reading, writing, solving, and building. Many hours are lost wandering in the middle of a subject.

I believe the sheer will of self-learning can be complemented by well-travelled teachers. The travelled teacher can guide learners across the middle, showing any number of paths, highlighting the true width of the subject. The learner decides which paths to pursue, saving time and focus.

# New Approach
The current model of teaching proved itself. Information evolved, however, to be always available. A gap separates students who expand their learning with the internet and its communities. The divide will grow.

I propose teaching adapt by focusing on its inherent strengths: building learning spaces for good mistakes, navigating the middle of a subject, and sparking interest by fitting the subject to the  learner's world.
