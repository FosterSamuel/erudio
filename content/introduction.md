Before college I privately tutored math. Some students thought they were inherently bad at the subject. In reality, years of rushed material and poor grades kept their shaky fundamentals unchecked. 

I wasn't concerned with pointing fingers.  For a Calculus student, instead of diving in, we reviewed Algebra. If their Algebra wasn't strong, we reviewed basic operations. Firm foundations let each student fight their pessimistic opinion of math.

After two years, I stopped tutoring and began studying computer science at Cal Poly Pomona. College exposed me to every kind of teacher. I learned English from the zealous Dr. Golden. His infectious storytelling sparked a genuine interest in the subject. Mr. Baumwirt taught me public speaking. He showed speaking as a standalone skill instead of an afterthought stemming from PowerPoint slides.

I also had forgettable teachers who recited from slides. We read faster than they spoke. Every week we listened in the faint hope they'd say something beyond what was written. We were continually disappointed.

Fueled by frustration, I worked with my friends Justin, Anirban, and Kiana to build the on-campus Software Engineering Association (SEA). We set out to grow each member's skills. While teaching throughout the club year, I tried multiple approaches. Some didn't work. Others were more effective than I expected.

Pedagogy is the art of teaching. I have no formal training in education, but this website is the digital organization of my thoughts and opinions on teaching. I learned under homeschooling, studied at a public college, tutored one-on-one, and taught at SEA. Additionally, I have the blind advantage of not knowing what is proper or trendy in the world of teaching.
