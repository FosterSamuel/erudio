*The below is a draft. Return soon for a full version.*

Before college I privately tutored math. Some students thought they were inherently bad at the subject. In reality, years of rushed material and poor grades kept their shaky fundamentals unchecked. 

I wasn't concerned with pointing fingers.  For a Calculus student, instead of diving in, we reviewed Algebra. If their Algebra wasn't strong, we reviewed basic operations. Firm foundations let each student fight their pessimistic opinion of math.

After two years, I stopped tutoring and began studying computer science at Cal Poly Pomona. College exposed me to every kind of teacher. I learned English from the zealous Dr. Golden. His infectious storytelling sparked a genuine interest in the subject. 

I also had forgettable teachers who only recited from PowerPoint slides. We read the slides faster than they spoke. They added nothing. Yet we listened in the faint hope they'd say something beyond what was written. Every week left us disappointed. 

Fueled by my frustration, I started the Software Engineering Association on campus. *. . . to be continued*
